Not much content here, but maybe I'll share some info about me:\r\n\r\n### About Me\r\nI live in Eastern Finland and work for a local small company that mainly focuses on industrial automation. At work I do everything from software development to physically building and installing machinery and robotics - and having so diverse job is great!\r\n\r\nWhile I do stuff normally engineers do, I have only a vocational college degree. Well actually I have two degrees, one for industrial automation and another for electrical engineering, both from Savo Vocational College between 2011-2015. Having no \"B. Eng\" title might change in the future, but I like doing my current job too much to switch from working to studying. Maybe at some point I will be able to study and work at the same time, we'll see.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessenic\r\n\r\nAnd Twitter: https://twitter.com/jessenic",
