<p>Hi! My name is Jesse Leskinen and you have just entered my personal website. Not much content here, but maybe I'll share some info about me:</p>

<h3>
<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I live in Eastern Finland and work for a local small company that mainly focuses on industrial automation. At work I do everything from software development to physically building and installing machinery and robotics - and having so diverse job is great!</p>

<p>While I do stuff normally engineers do, I have only a vocational college degree. Well actually I have two degrees, one for industrial automation and another for electrical engineering, both from Savo Vocational College between 2011-2015. Having no "B. Eng" title might change in the future, but I like doing my current job too much to switch from working to studying. Maybe at some point I will be able to study and work at the same time, we'll see.</p>
